Todo Exercise

This is a simple bootstrapped Todo app that needs some updates

## Github
To get started, make a new branch off master to which you will be committing your code. Once code is written, commit the code to your local branch and then push it up to the remote repo.

## Code Changes
A few things aren't hooked up or are broken, we will walk through getting these resolved. Files of interest are as follows
1 - TodoList.js
2 - TodoItem.js
2 - Filters.js

## Tests
In the file TodoList.test.js, we need to write a test to ensure that the list of todo items are being rendered.
To do this, we are using a library called react-testing-library written by Kent C Dodds [Testing Docs](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)

This library gives you some really great functionality to use for writing tests i.e. `render`, `container`, and `getByText`




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
